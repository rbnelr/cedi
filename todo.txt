DONE:
 
#2017.11.01 Mi abend
 forked from asteroids
 
#2017.11.01 Mi nacht
 switched from my own array class to std::vector and std::string (also std::array and std::initializer_list)
 reworked font rendering
 
#2017.11.02 Do abend
 switched shaders to top-zero pixel coordinates
 
 implemented basic cursor (no vertical cursor movement for now)
  -moving cursor (ARROW_LEFT, ARROW_RIGHT)
  -drawing cursor
  -deleting and inserting characters (type to insert, BACKSPACE to delete left DELETE to delete right)
 
 tab handling
 
 implemented toggable drawing of special characters (newline and tabs) (ALT+N)
 
 variable tab space count contollable (ALT+T+<generic increase/decrease buttons>) <generic increase/decrease buttons>
 
// git commit
 basic vertical cursor movement (same line character index for now (basicly assuming monospace)) (ARROW_UP, ARROW_DOWN)
 
#2017.11.03 Fr abend
 rewrite internal text representation as linked list of lines with std::vector for the line character data
 -> this should allow all editing in O(1) time scaling to line count (but still O(n) to line length, but those tend to be short)
 -> rewrote drawing code as draw_line
 
#2017.11.04 Sa tag
 -> rewrote again
 
 cursor box around char fits perfectly and was really simple to implement :)
 
 added all colors as user options
 added newline handling (\n \r and \r\n are all counted as one newline)
 
#2017.11.06 Mo tag-abend
 cursor x sticking working, but there might be a way to handle x sticking that feels even better
 
 while rewriting into event based drawing
  -> switched to event based drawing (draw after each char insert/cursor move and when the window
   needs to be refreshed (refresh callback))
  -> reimplemented character insert/delete
 
#2017.11.07 Di tag-abend
 do file loading first
 
#2017.11.08 Mi tag
 scrolling working
 
#2017.11.09 Do tag
 improved event based updating, no arkward pre_update() needed now
 
 scrolling working even when resizing the window
 -> cursor should never be able to move outside the window, since i call update_scroll before drawing
 
#2017.11.17 Fr tag
 scroll constrain to cursor working
 
TODO
-FEATURES:
 
 smooth scrolling
 
 shift select
 -> highlight selection
 -> deleting selected block with BACKSPACE/DELETE or by overwriting it via typing
 -> select copy and paste
 -> windows copy/paste clipboard would be useful
 -> line swap hotkey (CTRL-T in notepad++)
 
 reimplement some kind of cursor sticking (maybe my new idea?)
 
 file saving
 
 implement not allowing editing withing newline sequences?
 
 (as option) automaticly ensure that the last line always ends in newline ?
 
 
-BUGS:
