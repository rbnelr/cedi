DONE:
 
#2017.11.01 Mi abend
 forked from asteroids
 
#2017.11.01 Mi nacht
 switched from my own array class to std::vector and std::string (also std::array and std::initializer_list)
 reworked font rendering
 
#2017.11.02 Do abend
 switched shaders to top-zero pixel coordinates
 
 implemented basic cursor (no vertical cursor movement for now)
  -moving cursor (ARROW_LEFT, ARROW_RIGHT)
  -drawing cursor
  -deleting and inserting characters (type to insert, BACKSPACE to delete left DELETE to delete right)
 
 tab handling
 
 implemented toggable drawing of special characters (newline and tabs) (ALT+N)
 
 variable tab space count contollable (ALT+T+<generic increase/decrease buttons>) <generic increase/decrease buttons>
 
// git commit
 basic vertical cursor movement (same line character index for now (basicly assuming monospace)) (ARROW_UP, ARROW_DOWN)
 
#2017.11.02 Fr abend
 rewrite internal text representation as linked list of lines with std::vector for the line character data
 -> this should allow all editing in O(1) time scaling to line count (but still O(n) to line length, but those tend to be short)
 -> rewrote drawing code as draw_line
 
TODO
-FEATURES:
 
 -> rewrote again
 
 shift select
 -> highlight selection
 -> deleting selected block with BACKSPACE/DELETE or by overwriting it via typing
 -> select copy and paste
 -> windows copy/paste clipboard would be useful
 -> line swap hotkey (CTRL-T in notepad++)
 
-BUGS:
